# Sponsorship
Lottie is an open source project built and maintained by a single or very small group of people per platform. Almost all support and work is done on nights and weekends outside of any full time jobs. If you use Lottie and want to support its ongoing development, please considering having you or your company Sponsor Lottie. Each repo has a sponsorship section on the right side of the main repo with links to GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective.

## Github Sponsors

For [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors), contributions can be made from either an individual or an organization/company. Contributions are sent directly to specific maintainers of the project.

Most Lottie platforms are maintained by a single person. You can sponsor them here:
* Android: [Gabriel Peal](https://github.com/sponsors/gpeal)
* iOS: [Brandon Withrow](https://github.com/sponsors/buba447)
* Web: [Hernan Torrisi](https://github.com/bodymovin) (not accepting sponsorship at this time)

## Open Collective

Lottie also accepts sponsorship via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/lottie).

## Why Sponsor Lottie?

Lottie would not exist without thousands of hours of unpaid work on nights and weekends. Sponsoring Lottie ensures that all platforms continue to get the support and maintenance they need.

## What Do You Get?

Lots of stuff! The sponsorship tiers on GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective list the benefits of each tier. Some of the benefits include:
* Access to a Lottie Slack organization that has core contributors from all platforms.
* Prioritization for bugs, support, and feature requests.
* Inclusion on our README and documentation sites.
